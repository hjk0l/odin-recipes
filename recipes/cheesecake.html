    <h2>I will teach you how to make a cheesecake with these easy steps!</h2>
    <p>We will be taking ingredients that are easy to get to make a nice and tasty cheesecake.</p>
    <p>Make sure that your ingredients are at room temp.</p>
    <h3>What ingredients do we need?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>graham cracker dust</li>
        <li>32 oz cream cheese</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>1 <em>1/2</em> vanilla</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C).</li>
        <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust and pur the crumbs into a 9" Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides<br>of your pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).</li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for 50-60 minutes (or longer as needed, see note 3). Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just
        begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be jello. Don't over bake or the texture will suffer.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to coll on top of the oven for 10 minutes. Once the 10 minutes passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside
        of the springform pan. Do not remove the ring of the springform pan</li>
        <li>Allow cheescake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours.
        Remove the ring of the springform pan just before serving then return it to the pan to store.</li>
    </ol>
